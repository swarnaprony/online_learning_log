Project Learning Log:

Spec:
	We will write a web app called Learning Log that allows users 
	to log the topics they are interested inn and to make journal
	entries as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home
	page will describe the site and invite users to either register
	or logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, 
	and read and edit existing entries.
